                We've helped more founders build startups at the earliest
                possible stage than most anyone you'll meet, and that means we
                can help startups avoid the 1,000 landmines that can cause
                certain failure.
              </p>
              <p>
                We focus on investing in high-potential software startups at
                seed stage and earlier, with small teams that include great
                engineers, designers and product founders. Many companies come
                to us when they are just two or four people, and we help them
                get from there to their Series A or B rounds and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have an idea that is not reflected in our current
                portfolio, don’t be dissuaded from pitching us. We’re a firm
                that has often discovered the next technology wave through the
                talent in our network. For example, we knew Brian Armstrong
                through his work on risk management and fraud detection at
                Airbnb. But his next company had nothing to do with travel or
                hospitality — it was Coinbase, which has become one of the
                pre-eminent ways to hold, invest and trade Bitcoin and Ethereum
                in the world.

                        We’re a generalist VC and have funded early-stage
                        startups that touch nearly every sector. We have a
                        specific strength in software, and believe that every
                        kind of business will be re-made by great software
                        engineers creating things that are better, cheaper, and
                        faster than incumbent offerings.

                        Many of our best investments have come from talented
                        founders who shifted their skills into a new or untested
                        field. For example, when we invested in Kyle Vogt, he
                        hadn’t worked in autonomous vehicles for roughly a
                        decade since his undergraduate years, but then he went
                        on to create Cruise, which sold to GM for $1 billion. Or
                        when we invested in Brian Armstrong, he had worked in
                        fraud prevention at Airbnb before starting Coinbase.

                          market opportunities, but enormous ones that could
                          eventually grow to making more than a hundred million
                          dollars in revenue every year. We are underwriting
                          each investment to an exit that could potentially
                          return our fund.

                          big and compelling). These teams have no problem

                      We are founders and operators who know what it’s like to
                      start and grow a new company. We have created some of the
                      best-known and most loved brands on the modern web and we
                      have worked in disciplines across the industry from
                      engineering to product design to brand marketing to media
                      relations and public policy. We can help you in specific
                      areas like technical hiring, user acquisition or media
                      outreach because we have people on our team who have done
                      exactly those things for 10 years or more. As a culture,
                      we value helpfulness, pragmatism and responsiveness. We
                      are investors foremost, not managers. We want to help
                      companies find a path forward, but ultimately, the
                      founders must make the key decisions.

                      We aim to be fast and have a turnaround time of around two
                      weeks. If we’re a no, we’ll get back to you quickly and
                      explain why. We think that pitching should be a two-way
                      learning process where we both grow and learn from the
                      experience. If we move forward, you’ll need to meet every
                      general partner on the team. We don’t require unanimous
                      consent among the partnership, but it’s good to have at
                      least one or two partners being your champions.

                        We focus on early-stage investing, when teams tend to
                        include solely the founders or the founding team plus a
                        few first employees. Many of the teams we talk to have
                        already launched their products and already have the
                        beginnings of a revenue model, although this is not
                        required. We understand that products and business
                        models evolve, but it’s good to see in a very concrete
                        way how teams are able to ship product and work
                        together.

                        It’s never too early to start a conversation with us.
                        Often times, we meet founders right when they are
                        starting out and then we invest later once we see
                        progress.

                      We get a lot of warm introductions primarily from our
                      community of founders and builders, so if you pitch one of
                      our partners, it is helpful if you explicitly include
                      quantitative pieces of data that clearly demonstrate
                      traction such as your overall user base and its growth
                      rate or your monthly revenue run-rate and its growth rate.

                      We are proud to have large number of operators who have
                      spent years in engineering, design, communications and
                      policy. First, we use office hours to spend time working
                      through issues that founders commonly face, such as
                      prioritization, hiring and how and when to structure
                      fundraising. Then we have operators on the team who can
                      come in and help with user acquisition strategy, press
                      launches or product design. Founders can use these
                      services on an as-need basis; we don’t require companies
                      in the portfolio to use them.
